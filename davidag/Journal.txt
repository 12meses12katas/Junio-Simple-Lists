- Coded SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList and the generic test.

- [SinglyLinkedList] I realized that I was inserting new elements in the tail
  (like in an std::vector when you push_back en element) but it is more 
  efficient to insert new elements on the front.

- Added sentinel nodes to both lists.

- Templatized the list value types just to make the data structures more 
  generic.
  
- Refactored values() and find() in base class to avoid code duplication.

- Realised sentinel node in circular nodes must be per-object as next_ pointer
  is different for each list. I decide that every list has its own sentinel node
  which allows for code reuse and simplifies circular list implementation.

- All tests passed OK.

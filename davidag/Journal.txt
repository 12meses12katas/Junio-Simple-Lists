- Coded SinglyLinkedList, DoublyLinkedList and the tests. All tests passed OK.

- [SinglyLinkedList] I realized that I was inserting new elements in the tail
  (like in an std::vector when you push_back en element) but it is more 
  efficient to insert new elements on the front. All tests passed OK.
